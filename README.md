# Project
This is a project about Book Recommendation using variational autoencoders. I tried to find the most appropriate parameters for the dataset during the model training session. A comprehensive comparison of the performance of different models on different datasets was also made.

Version: conda 4.5.11 -python 3.9.18 -pytorch 1.12.1 -cudatoolkit 11.3.1

The RecVAE model used was derived from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3336191.3371831
