# Project
This is a project about Book Recommendation using variational autoencoders. I tried to find the most appropriate parameters for the dataset during the model training session. A comprehensive comparison of the performance of different models on different datasets was also made.

The RecVAE model used was derived from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3336191.3371831

The MultVAE model used was derived from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05814

The MacridVAE model used was derived from https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14238
